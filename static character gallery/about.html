    <p>
        This website was created for a class project to showcase fictional
        characters from different universes. I chose this theme because I grew up watching marvel, dc and other
        superhero shows and movies and also learnt of a lot of charactersfrom video games and it allowed me to practice
        HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.
